This project presents a visually structured Omelette Recipe webpage developed using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on layout organization, typography, and user-friendly design. The interface is centered using flexbox and wrapped inside a rounded container to create a clean, modern card-style appearance. Custom color palettes, Google Fonts, and consistent spacing are applied to clearly separate sections such as preparation time, ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information. The goal of this project is to demonstrate effective content hierarchy, semantic HTML usage, and thoughtful CSS styling for presenting informational content in an engaging and readable format.
